# Uber Clone Project

## Overview

This project is an Uber clone built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a basic interface for both users and captains to log in and book rides. The project was a significant learning experience, allowing me to explore various technologies and concepts in web development.

## Features

- User and Captain login functionality
- Ride booking interface
- Current fare tracking

## Important Note

Due to the limitations of the Google API Gateway prepayment system, I have decided to drop the live tracking and distance location features. However, I plan to complete these dropped features over time as I continue to learn and grow in my development skills. This decision was made to simplify the project and focus on the core functionalities.

## Learning Experience

Throughout the development of this project, I encountered numerous challenges and opportunities for growth. It has been one of the best learning experiences of my life, enhancing my skills in both frontend and backend development.
